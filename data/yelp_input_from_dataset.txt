I'm definitely a fan of East End Food Co-op. Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it. My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want! The same goes for the spices--such a bargain! The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!
