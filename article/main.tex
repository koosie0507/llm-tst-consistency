\title{How Consistent are LLMs in Applying Handcrafted Language Features}
\author{Andrei Olar --- andrei.olar@ubbcluj.ro}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    Large language models are sought for solving an increasing number of
    increasingly diverse tasks. Perhaps naturally one such task is text style
    transfer: the task of changing the style of a text while preserving its
    meaning. Besides the natural approach of fine-tuning a large language model,
    a simpler and cheaper alternative should also be investigated: using
    handcrafted language features to direct the large language model.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Large language models (LLMs)} have are a commonplace research topic
today.
Because language models such as BERT~\cite{devlin2018bert} or
GPT~\cite{gpt-2018,gpt2-2019,gpt3-2020} constantly advance the state of the art
on many natural language processing tasks, it has become natural to want to
evaluate the performance of these generalist models on ever more specialized
tasks.
We know from multiple surveys~\cite{minaee2024llmsurvey,zhao2023survey} and
benchmarks~\cite{papcode2024hellaswag,chiang2024chatbot} that large language
models (especially the more popular ones) are good at following instructions.
We can also intuit that training LLMs on diverse data (for instance the
Pile~\cite{gao2020pile}) uniquely qualifies them to produce text in a wide
variety of styles.

\textbf{Text style transfer (TST)} is defined as the ``task of transforming the
stylistic manner in which a sentence is written, while preserving the meaning of
the original sentence''~\cite{tst-review-2021}.
This definition can be extended to entire articles or corpuses of text because
these are also the object of linguistic style and
stylistics~\cite{lugea2023stylistics}.
The task of transfering text style is an old preocupation for the natural
language processing and computational linguistics communities which has picked
up interest again in the context of the advancements in the field of deep
learning and particularly since the inception of the transformer architecture.

\textbf{Handcrafted linguistic features (HLFs)} are single numerical values
produced by a uniquely identifiable method on any natural
language~\cite{lftk-2023}.
More often than not, these values are easy to compute while the methods used for
obtaining them are usually idempotent.
This makes them very attractive because of the dual purpose that they can serve.
On the one hand, they can be used to instruct the generation of text (``write
no more than 10 sentences'') while on the other they can be used to analyse text
and, therefore, verify generated text.

Some HLFs statistically describe text in terms of its basic syntactical and
morphological components.
Knowing this we could follow Noam Chomsky's ideas~\cite{chomsky2002syntactic}
which imply that the style of a text is influenced by its underlying syntactic
structures.
Traditionally, linguistic style was thought to be the result of morphological
and syntactic arrangements~\cite{lugea2023stylistics}.
More recent schools of thought on linguistic style find semantics and pragmatics
to be inextricably linked to author style~\cite{verma2019lexical}, but argue
that a great deal can still be inferred from lexicon, syntax and a `surface'
level which contains basic HLFs such as the number of words in a sentence.

For example, a high number of exclamations in a text is often a revealing
signal of an inflamatory news writing style, of spam or of alert narration or
dialogue.
Similar observations have been made about other characteristics of written text
that might be computed as HLFs~\cite{hovy1987generating,lugea2023stylistics}.
Combining multiple HLFs that are revelatory of linguistic style could provide us
with an easily interpretable and verifiable stylistic profile.

These apparently disparate strands of thought lead us to the two research
questions we'd like to answer in this paper.

Firstly, \textbf{is it possible to influence an LLM's writing style by
    instructing it to generate text that complies to certain HLFs}?
This problem of controlled text generation has implications for text style
transfer and authorship verification.
Answering this question might point out cheaper, less intrusive and more user
friendly solutions than fine tuning large language models for these tasks.
Fine tuning LLMs also incurs some loss of generality~\cite{yang2024unveiling},
going directly against the purpose of having a generic language model.

Secondly, we ask \textbf{if it's possible to quantify how closely an LLM is able
    to follow prompts concerning the compliance of the generated text to HLFs?}
The answer to this question could hint at a relatively simple and accurate way
of evaluating the quality of (partial) text style transfer using a large
language model.


\section{Related Work}\label{related}

There is abundent literature on the topic of text style transfer.
Reviews and surveys~\cite{tst-review-2021,tst-survey-2022} were helpful for
informing our selection of HLFs.
Studies on attaining fine-grained text style transfer using language models
have served as inspiration for writing this paper~\cite{lyu-etal-2023-fine}.
We should note though that we are not attempting to transfer text style, but
merely to instruct an LLM to follow instructions based on HLFs.

Linguistic style, then, is the sum of identifiable language choices manifest in
a text made from the language system by the text
producer~\cite{lugea2023stylistics}.
Another way to think about it is that style is the form used for delivering
meaning~\cite{tst_sigkdd_review_2022}.
The ample literature on the subject seems to agree that style depends on context
and author choice vis-a-vis a communication
goal~\cite{mcdonald1985computational,hovy1987generating}.
The author's choice is available at all linguistic levels, including the
morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
levels~\cite{dimarco1994model,lugea2023stylistics}.
The influence of syntactic structure over text style is apparent also from a
formalist perspective~\cite{chomsky2002syntactic}.
This work grounds our choice of handcrafted linguistic features related to
linguistic style.

The idea of constructing style from fine-grained aspects is not new and there
are excellent studies on the subject.
The StylePTB authors explain how this dataset leverages lexical, syntactic,
semantic and thematic aspects to allow verifying text style transfer more
thoroughly than previous methods~\cite{lyu-etal-2021-styleptb}.
Besides providing the understanding required to distinguish between semantic
transfer and other forms of style transfer, the dataset itself is useful for
evaluating HLFs that function at the sentence level.

The body of work on HLFs is extensive.
It is well referenced and synthesised by Lee and Lee~\cite{lftk-2023}.
To our knowledge there is no work that connects HLFs with LLMs in the manner
described in this paper.
HLFs are used in the context of other, connected tasks such as assessing text
readability~\cite{lee-etal-2021-pushing}.

In terms of controlling the style of the generated text, our approach differs
from others in at least two significant ways: simplicity and focus.
We are constructing well crafted user prompts for an LLM instead of diving into
more complex artificial intelligence solutions.
Our focus is on controlling text generation using HLFs and measuring the change
relative to a baseline obtained without using HLFs in the generation process.
We are not discussing the effectiveness of style transfer, author verification
or other tasks (yet).

Finally, this paper documents a form of controllable text generation
(CTG)~\cite{zhang-ctg-2022}.
Hightened recent interest in CTG and especially in benchmarking LLMs in the
context of CTG~\cite{chen2024benchmarking} is particularly relevant for this
paper.
Such research alleviates the burden of proof regarding the level to which
LLMs respond well to diversified instructions for controlled text generation in
general.
Compared to the existing work, our prompts are guided by HLFs.
Furthermore, we use those same HLFs to evaluate the performance of the LLM.


\section{Experiment Design}\label{method}

Our experiment consists of analysing the behavior of an LLM when asked to
generate new text based on a given input text and some instructions derived from
HLF statistics computed on a corpus containing multiple texts.
The experiment relies on choosing LLMs to evaluate and finding datasets from
which we can derive corpuses.
Then there's the matter of selecting the HLFs for our experiment.
Let us outline the experiment process before going into further detail.

The first task is to establish a baseline.
We do so by instructing the target LLM to generate text retaining the meaning of
the input text without any further instruction related to style or the
linguistic features of the generated text.
We repeat the text generation step 10 times using the same prompt and the same
input text.

For each text generation, we compute the following statistics for each of our
chosen HLFs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{min}: the minimum value of the HLF on the generated text;
    \item \textbf{max}: the maximum value of the HLF on the generated text;
    \item \textbf{avg}: the mean value of the HLF on the generated text;
\end{itemize}

A second baseline is obtained by following the same process and same input text,
but with a new prompt that builds upon the first one by adding the instruction
to use example text from our corpus of choice.
The examples are three texts chosen randomly once at the beginning of the
experiment from the used corpus.
We use the same example texts for all evaluated LLMs.

We choose three texts to not overrun the context window of the LLM.
This hints at the main drawback for our approach: it uses up the context window
with system instructions.
While this isn't an issue with all models, some only allow a context window of
around 8000 tokens so we should be mindful.

We construct the second baseline by conducting 10 trials using the same
prompt and input text and otherwise in the same manner in which we created the
first baseline.

The next step is to devise HLF prompts derived from both baseline prompts.
The HLF prompts contain additional instructions to generate text that would
comply with certain HLF values.
These HLF values are obtained by computing the statistics outlined above on
the entirety of the target benchmark dataset.
The HLF prompts are constructed from templates that take into account the HLF
values.
The prompt templates are available in the code repository that accompanies this
experiment~\cite{olar2024experimentcode}.
The instructions concerning all choseon HLFs are given concomitently within the
same prompt.
In a similar manner to how we generated the baselines, we run ten trials for
each case (with or without example articles from the target benchmark dataset).

We compare the first baseline with the results obtained by using the first
modified HLF prompt to understand whether we can influence LLM text generation
using HLFs.
Our reasoning is that if the LLM were influenced by the HLF prompt, the output
would show different HLF values compared to the baseline.

We now turn our attention to the second baseline.
Given that the LLM now also has example articles, it can freely immitate those
articles when generating the text.
If there is a consistent difference over the ten trials between generating text
using the baseline or using the HLF prompt, this difference can only be a result
of the LLM complying to HLF instructions.
This difference is expressed by the change of value for each HLF between the
baseline and HLF enhanced text generation.

Because we provide the LLM with examples from the corpus, it is more likely to
intuit the linguistic features of the corpus.
To understand whether HLF instructions actually make a difference, we perform
the experiment using the second type of prompt using input text both from within
and from outside the corpus.

One final observation before diving into details is that we can use an HLF's
variance on the benchmark dataset to our advantage.
This statistic shows whether the LLM takes the HLF prompts into account enough
for the generated text to fall within the parameters of the benchmark dataset.
Let us denote an HLF computed on a generated text using an HLF prompt with
$HLF_g$.
Similarly denote the average and the variance of the same HLF on the benchmark
dataset with $avg(HLF_b)$ and $var(HLF_b)$, respectively.
If we consistently notice that
\[HLF_g - var(HLF_b) \leq avg(HLF_b) \leq HLF_g + var(HLF_b)\]
then we consider that the LLM follows HLF prompts in a relevant way.

\subsection{LLM Selection}\label{llm-selection}

For our experiment we will use state of the art large language models.
We used the Chatbot Arena~\cite{chiang2024chatbot} leaderboard for constructing
our selection.
In the interest of covering more ground, we choose large language models from
different vendors.
Our choice includes four top performing LLMs and one model that anyone would be
able to run on their own hardware.
The final selection is available in Table~\ref{table-llm}.

    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{HLF Selection}\label{hlf-selection}

Our main focus is to understand how susceptible LLMs are to prompts containing
instructions to conform to HLFs.
LFTK authors~\cite{lftk-2023} categorize HLFs by domain and family and make
available information on the suitability of each HLF for given tasks such as
readability assessment or fake news detection.
Besides the domain and family, we also choose features based on their influence
over text style as recognized in literature~\cite{verma2019lexical,lugea2023stylistics}.

In this experiment we create specific instructions for each HLF.
The resulting instructions can be catalogued on the concrete-abstract spectrum.
For example, `write 100 words' is a more concrete instruction than `write as if
you were in junior highschool'~\cite{kincaid1975derivation}.
We divide HLFs in five categories ranging from very concrete to highly abstract
and choose 2 features from each category for a grand total of 10 HLFs.
Table~\ref{table-hlf} showcases our selection of features.

\begin{table}[ht]

    \caption{Handcrafted Linguistic Features}\label{table-hlf}
\end{table}
\footnotetext{as described in the figure in~\cite{lugea2023stylistics}, chapter 1, page 7}

Each of these features is well documented~\cite{lftk-2023} barring the need for
a deeper dive here into the subject matter.

\subsection{DataSet Selection}\label{ds-selection}

We must choose source datasets based upon which we create corpuses for our
experiment.
Our final selection of datasets is listed in Table~\ref{table-ds}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \setlength\tabcolsep{6pt}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
        \toprule
        Name              & Task                     & Row Count & Content Type & Reference              \\ \toprule
        Yelp Reviews      & Sentiment Classification & 50000     & Reviews      & \cite{yelp2015neurips} \\
        (test split)      & Text Style Transfer      &           &              &                        \\
                          & Text Classification      &           &              &                        \\ \midrule
        CNN / DailyMail   & Summarization            & 11490     & News         & \cite{cnndm2015}       \\
        (test split)      & Question Answering       &           & Stories      & \cite{cnndm2017}       \\
                          & Text Generation          &           &              &                        \\ \midrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Source Datasets}\label{table-ds}
\end{table}

We use the Huggingface ecosystem~\cite{lhoest-etal-2021-datasets} to load the
datasets.
Yelp reviews are loaded from \texttt{Yelp/yelp\_review\_full}, while CNN stories
are loaded from \texttt{abisee/cnn\_dailymail}.

The Yelp review data set provides a diverse assortment of reviews from online
users.
The authors employ a casual writing style, very similar to what a average
writing style of an average person would be like.
The dataset as a whole is useful for many tasks.
The corpus we construct based on this dataset contains the first 1000 reviews
from its test split.

CNN/DailyMail contains stories and news with diverse styles.
The style varies from one author to another, but also based on the publishing
entity.
The articles are more formal, longer and more complex in structure than Yelp
reviews which makes this dataset a good alternative choice.
The corpus that is based on this dataset contains the first 1000 CNN articles
from the test split of the dataset.


\subsection{User Prompt and Text}\label{input-text}

This experiment presupposes instructing various large language models to reword
an input text so that it conforms to a bunch of handcrafted linguistic features.
The input text is provided via a user prompt.

We provide two input texts that are external to our corpuses, one input text per
corpus.
They can be examined online in the
\texttt{\href{https://github.com/koosie0507/llm-tst-consistency/tree/main/data}{data}}
folder of the experiment's Git repository~\cite{olar2024experimentcode}.
These user prompts are used when we're not using an input text from the
corpus itself.

For the CNN/DailyMail dataset, the user prompt from outside the dataset is an
extract from the classic text \textit{The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy,
Gentleman}, by Laurence Sterne~\cite{sterne2003life}.
This text is far from a news article in terms of both style and exhibited
linguistic features from the CNN/DailyMail dataset contents.
We see a text that is similarly divorced from the style and linguistic
features of most Yelp reviews in Oscar Wilde's \textit{Sonnet to
Liberty}~\cite{wilde1909poems}.
Having input texts that are vastly different from a dataset should inform an LLM
to generate a baseline that does not conform to the linguistic features of the
dataset.

We use Jinja templates to compile the text generation instructions for the LLM.
Both the model prompts and the HLF instructions are constructed using these
templates.
The Jinja templates are available in the 
\texttt{\href{https://github.com/koosie0507/llm-tst-consistency/tree/main/data}{templates}}
folder of the experiment's Git repository~\cite{olar2024experimentcode}.

There are two main text generation instruction templates: one without example
content~(called `\texttt{prompt\_1}') and one with examples from the
corpus~(`\texttt{prompt\_2}').
Each of the two instruction templates allow the presence of HLF instructions.

\section{Experiment Results}

\subsection{Interpretation Conventions}

Handcrafted linguistic features are integer or floating point values that we
can compute on text.
All our graphs show the HLF on the vertical axis, while the horizontal axis is
reserved for the trial number.
HLF values for the text generated using baseline prompts are plotted as a
continuous grey line, while the values obtained by using HLF enhanced prompts
are plotted using a continuous grenat line.
The minimum and maximum HLF on the benchmark dataset are plotted using dotted
black lines.
A continuous black line designates the average HLF on the corpus.
We sometimes refer to this average as the \textit{target} value because the LLM
is primarily instructed to conform to this value.

Result tables highlight the difference between plots obtained using a
baseline prompt versus the ones obtained using HLF-enhanced prompts.
Firstly, we care about the difference between each plot (baseline and HLF) and
the target (the corpus average).
Secondly, we measure how different baselines are from HLF-enhanced plots.

We use the two-sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov~\cite{kolmogorov1933,smirnov1939} test
to determine whether the baseline results are different from the HLF-enhanced
results.
We consider that the results are different for a resulting $p\_value \le 0.05$.

To determine which of the two results is closer to the target, we compute the
area between each result and the target.
Another way to measure the geometric closeness to the target is by computing the
Euclidian norm of the vectorial difference between result and target.
Let us denote with $A_b$ and $A_h$ the areas between baseline and target and HLF
instruction result and target, respectively.
Let us similarly denote with $N_b$ and $N_h$ the Euclidian norms.
Finally, we define $Diff_A = A_b - A_h$ and $Diff_N = N_b - N_h$.

The result tables show $Diff_A$ and $Diff_N$ for each LLM in the context of a
prompt and a dataset.
All result tables for each dataset and prompt variant are available online, in
the experiment's Git repository~\cite{olar2024experimentcode}.

In the next sections we only present the most relevant results of the
experiment.
To save space, we illustrate significant differences between the baseline and
the HLF instruction results in \textbf{bold} typeface.
The \underline{underlined} values represent situations when the HLF-enhanced
prompt lead to results that are closer to the corpus average than the baseline.
\textit{Italicized} values represent situations when the baseline was closer
to the target than the HLF-enhanced result.

\subsection{Can an LLM Follow HLF Instructions?}

The results on the CNN-DailyMail dataset showcased in
Table~\ref{table-cnn-dailymail-results} provide the most eloquent answer to this
question.
The results on the Yelp dataset are positive, albeit less convincing.

Command-R+ was the best performer by far, while Llama3 (8B) was predictibly the
worst at following HLF instructions.
Figure~\ref{fig-command-r-t-word} shows a positive result, where the result
obtained with the aid of HLF instructions is closer to the target.
Figure~\ref{fig-gpt-fkgl} shows a negative result, where the baseline is closer
to the target.
Figure~\ref{fig-llama-simp-ttr} shows an inconclusive result.

\subsection{Context Aware}

In this variant of the experiment, we feed the LLM three examples from the
corpus.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Yes, you can instruct at least some of the LLMs with HLFs.

compute BLEU, meteor, cider on styleptb using these LLMs and the prompt to
evaluate whether we actually achieve style transfer because of/in spite of HLF
instructions.
Human survey (amazon mechanical turk) on whether the text generations are good
or not. Likert scale (0 no good, 10 matches style perfectly)
